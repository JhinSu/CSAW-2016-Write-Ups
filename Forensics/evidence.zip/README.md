# CSAW CTF 2016 Quals: evidence.zip

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 100
**Solves:** 170
**Description:**

As part of CSAW CTF's ongoing efforts to terminate cheaters with extreme prejudice, we were supposed to have evidence incriminating a handful of teams in this zip file. I do not know what happened, but I do not think the evidence actually made it in there...

## Write-up
string evidence.zip will dump out a bunch of gibberish, but at the end you find something like this:
