# CSAW CTF 2016 Quals: Kill

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 50
**Solves:** 670
**Description:**

Is kill can fix? Sign the autopsy file?

## Write-up

`kill.pcapng` is corrupted. Sending it through pcapfix should fix it. You'll find the flag if you open the new pcap file in wireshark and follow the stream.

### Flag

`flag{roses_r_blue_violets_r_r3d_mayb3_harambae_is_not_kill}`
